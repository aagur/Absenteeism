# Absenteeism

### Purpose:
Explore whether a person certain characteristic is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not.
We will compare different classification models to obtain high performance.


### Dataset:
The database was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil and downladed from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work.

### Table of contents.
  1. Importing relevant libraries.
  2. Data explotation and preprocessing.
  3. Building and training models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machines (Linear & Radial)).
  4. Evaluating models.
  5. Hyper-Parameters Tuning.
  6. Choosing the best model.
  
### Software
The analysis and implementation has been done using Python 3.7.4 version.
